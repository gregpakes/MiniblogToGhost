Miniblog to Ghost migrator

This is the console application that I wrote to migrate from MiniBlog to Ghost.  It is extremely rough and ready and you will definitely need to make changes to it to make it work for you.

There are a number of assumptions:

 - You have an export of all your posts with images
 - Cloudinary is going to host your images

As I have said previously, you will need to make changes to the source code to get it to work for you.
